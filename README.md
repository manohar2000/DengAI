# DengAI
# Objective 
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world.It has emerged as one of the major epidemics in the world.Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation.Thus we are able to correlate this disease with climatic conditions.

# Approach
We tackled this problem by applying stats models and a machine learning model. The evaluation metric was Mean Absolute Error and the following are the results we achieved:

  1)ARIMA model: 32.23
  2)ARIMAX model: 26.85
  3)Random Forest Regressor: 24.75

It is exciting as we were able to achieve a rank of 811 out of 9k teams.
